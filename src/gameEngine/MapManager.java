	/**
	 * MapManager.java is the corresponding back-end engine module for Map.java, the gamePlayer module in the front-end. 
	 * Responsibilities include: (keep adding to this as responsibilities grow and diverge: 
	 * - being able to either read the map model from XML, or have it passed to itself 
	 * - keeping inventory of the units on the board, including bullets, enemies, troops, and towers. 
	 * - storing the path on the board in a PathModel 
	 * - updating the position and or velocity of every piece on the map that can move. 
	 * - handling Requests from the front-end Map whenever collisions occur between pieces, and removing/updating pieces as that happens. 
	 * - spawning new enemies and placing them onto the Map 
	 * - remaining extensible to further use cases and development. 
	 * 
	 * TODO: (update as needed)
	 * - Be able to translate a List<Path> to a PathModel in order to improve performance and remove any possibility of duplication
	 * - Handle Requests from Map.java and updating the pieces involved in the Request as needed. 
	 * - Communicating with the sprite utility in order to animate movable pieces on the board. 
	 * - Re-factoring the entire class in order to keep with extensible design patterns
